## Healthcare Data Analysis in Power BI

![](/images/Analyzing_Healthcare_Data_pages/Analyzing_Healthcare_Data_page1.png)

In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. In this Power BI Project, I explored a real-world dataset (The health information in this dataset is not individually identifiable. This means the dataset does not contain personal health information.) to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a consulting company called HealthStat. I analyzed attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. I used my Power Query DAX and Power BI Desktop skills to clean/transform data, create measures and generate insightful visualizations. To finish off, i have compiled it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights for the HealthStat team.

## Customer Churn Analysis in Power BI

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI Project, i investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn‚Äôt just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it‚Äôs also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.

![](/images/hr_analytics_reporting_pages/hr_analytics_reporting_page1.png)

In this Power BI project, I explored a Human Resources (HR) dataset for a fictitious software company, Atlas Labs, to showcase my skills in Power BI. I focused on importing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing HR data to uncover meaningful insights.

I performed exploratory data analysis and leveraged DAX to create dynamic, interactive visualizations. My analysis included a deep dive into employee attrition, identifying key factors that influence turnover and providing actionable insights for improving retention.

The final deliverable was a professionally designed Power BI report with a clean, branded layout, highlighting critical HR metrics and insights for business decision-making.

Skills demonstrated: Power BI, Data Modeling, DAX, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, HR Analytics, Report Design.

## Analyzing Job Market Data in Power BI

![](/images/Analyzing_Job_Market_pages/Analyzing_Job_Market_page1.png)

In this project, I explored a real-world job posting dataset for a fictional recruitment company, DataSearch, to analyze trends in the data science and analytics job market. I used Power Query to investigate, clean, and transform the data, uncovering which skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers.

I applied DAX to create dynamic visualizations that highlighted key trends and insights. Finally, I combined all findings into an interactive, business-ready Power BI dashboard, enabling the DataSearch team to make informed decisions and answer critical questions about talent demand.

Skills demonstrated: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Dashboard Design, Job Market Analytics.
