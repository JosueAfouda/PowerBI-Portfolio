The first page contains sales report by country, segment, discount band and product. It also contains a multi row card at the top, to display the Total Amounts, Profit % and Average Order. There are few slicers on the right hand side to see the report by different selection range.

The second page of report contains Tooltip reporting which is linked with the third page. DAX Dynamic Measure and Bookmarks technics are also used along with the map, area chart and line-clustered column chart to display total amounts, profit by coutries and month.

The top section of all the report page contains flag (Country), date, category and sub category slicers along with total and gross amounts. The internet and reseller sales total and margin details are calculated through DAX measure. The third page of report has DAX Dynamic measure for both internet and reseller to select the donut charts individually.
